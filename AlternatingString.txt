Problem Statement
A string of zeros and ones is called an alternating string if no two adjacent characters are the same. Examples of alternating strings: "1", "10101", "0101010101".

You are given a s. Each character of s is a '0' or a '1'. Please find the longest contiguous substring of s that is an alternating string. Return the length of that substring.
Definition
Class: AlternatingString
Method: maxLength
Parameters: string
Returns: integer
Method signature: def maxLength(self, s):
Limits
Time limit (s): 2.000
Memory limit (MB): 256
Constraints
- s will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.
- Each character in s will be '0' or '1'.
Examples
0)
"111101111"
Returns: 3
Among all substrings, there are 5 different alternating strings: "1", "0", "10", "01", "101". The one with maximal length is "101" and the length is 3.
1)
"1010101"
Returns: 7
The string s itself is an alternating string.
2)
"000011110000"
Returns: 2
Note that a substring must be contiguous. The longest alternating substrings of this s are "01" and "10". The string "010" is not a substring of this s.
3)
"1011011110101010010101"
Returns: 8
4)
"0"
Returns: 1
